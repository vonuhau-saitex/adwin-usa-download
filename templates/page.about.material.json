In contrast to conventional cotton, which uses genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and toxic pesticides and fertilizers that degrade the soil, organic cotton is grown without harmful chemicals, and the soil is enriched through crop rotation, intercropping and composting.<\/p><p><br\/>Because the soil is healthier and it retains water more efficiently, organic cotton uses 91% less water and emits 46% less greenhouse gas than conventional cotton.
